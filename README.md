Project 1: Temperature Converter

This project will teach you how to convert temperature from one scale to another in real-time!

In the first part you'll be building the basic frontend, which means the way the page is going to look using only HTML/CSS. In the second part you'll be writing the logic that will allow a user to convert the temperature from one temperature scale to another (i.e. Celsius to Fahrenheit)
